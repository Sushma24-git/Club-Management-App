# Club-Management-App
Club management is an android application that is a one stop solution for management of different clubs and societies in universities /schools. It bridges the gap between the club team and students. Students can find required club information easily and also register for the same. 

In our project we’re trying to build a platform that will help students get easy access to various clubs. An admin can also keep track of all the club members. A
confirmation message is sent when students register for any particular club notifying them about the same. A database is created, and it stores information about all the students and the respective clubs that they’ve registered for. As students ourselves finding clubs or association that comes under our area of interest felt like too much of a task. Solving this problem was the key agenda of our project. It has easy registration and check-ins, the ability to manage distributed audience and can also be used for promotions.
